# LowpassHighpassFilter
Lowpass and Highpass filter program for audio engineering using JUCE Framework

Filters in audio engineering are used for cutting off high/low frequencies, to clean out the sound (highpass) by cutting low frequencies or make it darker/muddier by adding a lowpass. Not only it can be used as a technical tool, but there are also lots of creative possibilities with such a plug-in. It is also awesome for so called "paralell compression". 

I've made it using JUCE Framewok (you can get it from here):
